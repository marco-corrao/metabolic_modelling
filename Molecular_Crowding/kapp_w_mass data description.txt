kapp and protein abundance data taken from Heckman et al(2020) and Davidi et al.
id= BIGG ID of the reaction
dir=direction in which the kapp was measured
gene=gene associated to the reaction in EColi (only homomeric enzymes considered)
kapp: apparent kcat in (1/s)
kapp source: Source of the kapp
pp_mass: MW of the polypeptide in Daltons
pp_abundance: Measured concentration of the polypeptide (in fmol/gDW)
pp_abundance source: source of the abundance data
pp_abundance mass: calculated  concentration of the polypeptide (in g/gDW)
