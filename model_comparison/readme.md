Quantitative comparison between our model, the core model, and the genome scale model (iML1515).
Current analysis includes:
- Basic model statistics (number of genes, reactions, metabolites, etc)
- maximum achievable growth on different substrates/conditions 
- production envelopes for different products under aerobic/anaerobic conditions
- optimal knockout strategies for overproduction of selected target metabolites (coming up)
